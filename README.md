## Task description

(from Data36 course)

## Dilan's Travel Guide 

In the final task, you will get a brand new data set from a brand new (also fictional) online business! 

Disclaimer: this is not a real business. Any similarity to reality is purely coincidental. 

Let me introduce: Dilan's Travel Guide

Dilan is a world traveler and a solo entrepreneur. He writes a travel blog where he sells info products: a $8 e-book (World Travelers' Best Practices) and a $80 video course (How To Travel the World). 

On his blog he has thousands of readers every day, coming from three sources: Reddit, SEO and AdWords. 

Dilan writes about his travel experiences covering the 6 main continents of the planet - these are the main categories on the blog. 
The business strategy is simple: 

 1.	New readers visit the blog.
 2.	They read articles.
 3.	They subscribe to the newsletter.
 4.	They purchase the info products.

Dilan's travel blog is available in 8 (and only 8) different countries. 
The marketing budget is not too high at the moment: Dilan spends only ~$1000 a month combined: 

 * for Adwords advertisement (~$500 a month for paid ads),
 * for SEO (~$250 a month for editing) and
 * for Reddit (~$250 for content creation)

And he only has two products!

He wants to invest more (time, work and money). But how to do that the most efficiently? What should he focus on?
That's where he needs your help!
